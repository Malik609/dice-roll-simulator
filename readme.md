A dice roll simulator is a simple program or application that simulates the rolling of a standard six-sided dice (a die with faces numbered 1 through 6).
The primary purpose of a dice roll simulator is to generate random outcomes, just like rolling a physical die, 
and it is often used in various games and applications for randomization.
